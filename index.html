HTML=hyper text markup langauge, text content is what you see on the internet and markup is how it looks<br>
<br>How the web works-Your browser on your computer makes HTTP requests which are sent to servers which send<br>
back HTML documents to be seen on your browser<br>
<br>
Elements-What HTML document are made of<br><br>
Tags-what is used to manipulate elements, example: < b > < /b >-this is the bold tag it needs both an opening <br>
and closing tag around the section of text you want to highlight like <b>THIS</b> but this is not true for all tags<br>
example: < br > this produces a line break like the ones you see throughout this HTML document<br><br>
Inline Tags-the two last discussed tags are called inline tags becasue they occur in line and are different from<br>
"cousin" Block tags<br><br>
Block tags- are tags that create a block around what ever is effected by the tage making that area seperate from<br>
the rest of the area
<br><br>
Finally remeber computers are stupid they need to be told what to do and that can only happen when you tell<br>them what to do for example if you dont close a tag the computer will <b> make all of the following text bold<br> so remeber it is you who needs to write the instructions
